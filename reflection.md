## Reflection on Chapter 2
I would say that Chapter 2 has made me more aware of how crucial naming is for the code quality. In the other courses that we previously had, I focused more on making the code work than making it more readable. Now I understand that naming is like a communication between programmers.

In my Note module, I notice that I already followed some rules without thinking about it, especially *Use Intention-Revealing Names* and *Class Names as Nouns*. However, I also see some room for improvement, especially with the pickColor function. For some people, maybe the name suggest that the function chooses between multiple colors, while in reality it validates a color and provides a default. A better name would maybe have been validateColor, as I said in the naming table above.

I also appreciate/like the rule *Don’t Be Cute* because I think it’s easy to get creative with names. But for me, clarity is more important than being creative, and I think I have straightforward names in my code like *Note*, *Notebook*, *add*, and so on.
